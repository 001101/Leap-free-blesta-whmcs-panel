# Questions

### How to prove we won't roll over for clowns (cough WebPros) some day in the future

* Crypto-something with locked funds in tokens/wallets ❔
* Old school notarial deed ❔
* Reputation ❔
* We can't ❔
* Stop selling WHMCS modules ✔️

### Customer support

* Github ✔️
* Stack Overflow ❔
* Forum ✔️
* Ticket ❔

# Conventions

* Avoid nested `if`, `return` instead
* Stick to `AND`, `OR` instead of `&&`, `||` logic operators. Many devs don't know anything about precedence
* Classes `StudlyCaps`. Methods & variables `camelCase`
* Same spacing for js and PHP
* Avoid `;` for last CSS rule
* Data as `array` not `StdClass`

# Internal Notes

* Navigation & actions vs sidebars, navbar, cog
* No js? Gtfo mode
* Downlolad application/octect
* User roles: pages & actions
